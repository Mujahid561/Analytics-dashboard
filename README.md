<!-- Project Overview -->

This is a React project that utilizes various libraries for state management, routing, and chart visualization. It is designed to provide a robust foundation for building interactive web applications such as analytical dashboard.

<!-- Technologies Used -->

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
React Router: For navigating between different views of the application.
Chart.js and React Chart.js 2: For rendering charts.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
Testing Libraries: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.

<!-- Installation -->

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

<!-- Clone the repository: -->

git clone https://github.com/Mujahid561/Analytics-dashboard.git
cd proj

<!-- Install the dependencies: -->

Make sure you are in the project directory.
Run the following command to install all required packages:

npm install

<!-- Running the Project -->

To start the development server, use the following command:

npm start
Your app will be available at http://localhost:3000 in your web browser.

<!-- Testing -->

To run the tests for your application, use:

npm test
This command will launch Jest and run all test cases defined in your project.

<!-- Building for Production -->

To create an optimized production build, run:

npm run build
This will generate a build folder containing a minified version of your app for deployment.

<!-- Ejecting the App -->

If you want to customize the configuration of Create React App, you can eject the app by running:

npm run eject
Note: This action is irreversible. It will expose all the configuration files, making it more difficult to maintain updates from Create React App.
